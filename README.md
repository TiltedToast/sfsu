Super fast replacements and additions to scoop commands written in Rust

## Installation

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras

scoop install sfsu
```

## Hook

You may set up the hooks to use the scoop commands normally

Add the following to your Powershell profile

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&sfsu hook)
```

You can also optionally disable certain hooks via the `--disable <COMMAND>` flag

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&sfsu hook --disable list)
```

It also supports Bash in WSL and MSYS2

Add the following to your .bashrc (or its equivalents, i.e .zshrc) file

```bash
source <(sfsu.exe hook --shell bash)
```

Nushell is also supported. Run the following command save it to a file.

```sh
sfsu hook --shell nu | save -f path/to/some/file.nu
```

Then source it in your `config.nu` (situated in path `$nu.config-path`).

```sh
source path/to/the/file.nu
```

The above disable demonstration also works

## Benchmarks [^1]

> [!NOTE]
> These benchmarks may not accurately represent the speeds on your system.
> While they do provide a relative measurement, your environment and results **will** be different.

On average, `sfsu search` is **~400** times faster than regular `scoop search` and **~5** times faster than [scoop-search](https://github.com/shilangyu/scoop-search).

`sfsu list` is **~35** times faster than `scoop list`

<!--TODO: A more detailed comparison of sfsu and hok-->

`sfsu` and `hok` are pretty comperable in all benchmarks. `sfsu` wins some benchmarks and `hok` wins others.

Done on a _AMD Ryzen 9 7900X @ 5.5GHz_ with _32GB_ of RAM at 5200MHz and 11 scoop buckets, as listed below

### Info [^info-version]

Hok does not have the `Updated at` and `Updated by` fields.
As such, for the sake of fairness, I have split the benchmark in two.

The first benchmark compares `sfsu` without these fields to Hok,
and the second benchmark compares `sfsu` with these fields to Scoop.

```shell
$ hyperfine --warmup 5 'sfsu info sfsu' 'scoop info sfsu'
Benchmark 1: sfsu info sfsu
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):     167.8 ms Â±   2.3 ms    [User: 0.0 ms, System: 1.0 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):   163.8 ms â€¦ 171.7 ms    15 runs

Benchmark 2: scoop info sfsu
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):     595.1 ms Â±   5.3 ms    [User: 137.5 ms, System: 60.9 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):   587.6 ms â€¦ 603.8 ms    10 runs

Summary
  sfsu info sfsu ran
    3.55 Â± 0.06 times faster than scoop info sfsu
```

```shell
$ hyperfine --warmup 5 'sfsu info sfsu --disable-updated' 'hok info sfsu'
Benchmark 1: sfsu info sfsu --disable-updated
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      56.6 ms Â±   1.3 ms    [User: 0.4 ms, System: 0.0 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):    54.7 ms â€¦  61.3 ms    37 runs

Benchmark 2: hok info sfsu
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      68.2 ms Â±   1.5 ms    [User: 5.9 ms, System: 2.4 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):    65.6 ms â€¦  70.8 ms    32 runs

Summary
  sfsu info sfsu --disable-updated ran
    1.20 Â± 0.04 times faster than hok info sfsu
```

## Long Term Goals

I have a couple of long term goals.

Firstly, I want to create a Rust library to help interacting with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) from code. This library would allow for things like installing packages, running updates, etc.
It will likely start by providing a function to get the Scoop install path, but hopefully over time it will grow into a fully fledged library, which is used internally by sfsu to interact with Scoop.

My other long term goal is to create a Scoop replacement for those who want it, in a similar vein as [Shovel](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Core). This is a fairly large undertaking and will definitely take me a lot of time, so this is a very long term goal, and may never happen. Despite this I never really plan to replace Scoop. It is a great package manager and if anything `sfsu` would just be a command you can run instead of Scoop, but would run on Scoop installations.

In the meantime I will continue working on this independently of Scoop as a collection of seperate tools that work in conjunction with Scoop.
