# Installation

The easiest, and recommended way to install SFSU is to use the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) package manager, like so:

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
# Or, for all the cool stuff I have in my personal bucket as well
scoop bucket add juliette https://github.com/jewlexx/personal-scoop.git

scoop install sfsu
```

This will download the latest release, check hashes and what not

Otherwise, you may download the latest release from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/jewlexx/sfsu/releases/latest), and do all the checking yourself

All releases are also on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), for you to check the hashes
